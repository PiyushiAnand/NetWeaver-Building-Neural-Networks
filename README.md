# NetWeaver-Building-Neural-Networks
This project is designed to take beginners on a comprehensive journey through the world of programming, data manipulation, machine learning, and neural networks. It combines learning Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, supervised machine learning, and basic neural networks with a practical application â€“ the creation of a Handwritten Digit Recognizer from scratch.

Week-1: Learning Python from Scratch, Data Manipulation with Pandas, Numpy and Data Visualization with Matplotlib.

Week-2: Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning.

Week-3: Fundamentals of Basic Neural Networks.

Week-4: Final Project i.e. Implementation of a Hand-written Digit Recognizer from scratch.
