# NetWeaver-Building-Neural-Networks
This project is designed to take beginners on a comprehensive journey through the world of programming, data manipulation, machine learning, and neural networks. It combines learning Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, supervised machine learning, and basic neural networks with a practical application â€“ the creation of a Handwritten Digit Recognizer from scratch.
